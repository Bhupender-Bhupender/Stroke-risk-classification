# Stroke Prediction using Classification Models

## 📌 Project Description
This classification project uses healthcare data to predict the **likelihood of a stroke** occurring based on features like:
- Age, Hypertension, Heart Disease
- Smoking Status, BMI
- Glucose levels
- Gender, Work Type, Marital Status

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is publicly available and contains anonymized patient data with a binary target variable indicating stroke occurrence.

## 🧠 Model Overview
- **Goal**: Predict whether a patient is likely to suffer a stroke
- **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
